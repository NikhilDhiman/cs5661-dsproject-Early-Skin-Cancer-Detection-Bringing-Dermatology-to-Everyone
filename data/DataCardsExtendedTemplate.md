# ISIC 2024 - Skin Cancer Detection with 3D-TBP
The SLICE-3D dataset is a large-scale, real-world collection of standardized skin lesion images used for skin cancer detection. It features JPEG image crops (15x15 mm field of view) extracted from 3D Total Body Photography (TBP) using the Vectra WB360 system by Canfield Scientific. These images represent the complete cutaneous surface of patients from diverse populations across nine institutions on three continents, spanning from 2015 to 2024.

Each image corresponds to a lesion identified by AI-based software and is linked to metadata provided in a CSV file, which includes a binary diagnostic label (target: malignant = 1, benign = 0), patient demographics (e.g., age, sex), lesion site, image source, and diagnosis type. Labels are either strong (histopathologically confirmed) or weak (clinical assessment only).

This dataset is designed for binary classification tasks-predicting the probability that a given lesion is malignant. It is valuable for training machine learning models in dermatological diagnostics, particularly in non-dermoscopic contexts. The dataset supports the development of scalable skin cancer screening tools and aims to improve early detection by mimicking real-world imaging scenarios, making it suitable for both clinical research and AI-driven healthcare applications.

### Collection Criteria
#### Data Selection
<!-- scope: telescope -->
<!-- info: Summarize the data selection criteria.

Use additional notes to capture any other relevant information or
considerations. -->
- **Collection Method of Source:** Lesions were extracted from standardized 3D total body photography (TBP) images captured using the Vectra WB360 system. All selected lesions had corresponding metadata, and selection was automated using the TBP Lesion Visualizer system, which identified and cropped regions of interest.
- **Collection Method of Source:** Priority was given to lesions with available diagnostic outcomes and metadata fields such as sex, age, clinical site, and lesion size, to support multimodal ML analysis.
- **Collection Method of Source:** Only lesions from contributing institutions within the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) network were considered for inclusion.

**Additional Notes:** Automated detection algorithms were employed to minimize bias in manual selection. Lesions lacking minimum metadata or ambiguous cropping results were discarded during preprocessing.

#### Data Inclusion
<!-- scope: periscope -->
<!-- info: Summarize the data inclusion criteria.

Use additional notes to capture any other relevant information or
considerations. -->
- **Collection Method of Source:** Included lesions had clearly defined and localized crops in 15x15mm field-of-view windows, consistent with the Vectra WB360 imaging specifications.
- **Collection Method of Source:** Metadata fields required for inclusion included age, sex, anatomical location, lesion ID, and imaging source.
- **Collection Method of Source:** Inclusion also required a confirmed diagnostic label (either strong – histopathology-based or weak – clinician-based).

**Additional Notes:** The dataset ensures demographic and geographic diversity by including data from nine clinical centers across three continents, spanning the years 2015 to 2024.
#### Data Exclusion
<!-- scope: microscope -->
<!-- info: Summarize the data exclusion criteria.

Use additional notes to capture any other relevant information or
considerations. -->
- **Collection Method of Source:** Lesions with poor image quality, occlusions, or ambiguous boundaries were excluded after visual and algorithmic QC.
- **Collection Method of Source:** Records with missing or inconsistent key metadata (e.g., age, anatomical site) were filtered out before dataset curation.
- **Collection Method of Source:** Duplicate lesions or crops with overlapping coordinates across scans or timepoints were also removed to ensure independence across instances.

**Additional Notes:** Images used in the validation/test sets were not drawn from patients included in the training set, ensuring patient-level disjoint partitions.

### Relationship to Source
#### Use & Utility(ies)
<!-- scope: telescope -->
<!-- info: Describe how the resulting dataset is aligned with the purposes,
motivations, or intended use of the upstream source(s).

Use additional notes to capture any other relevant information or
considerations.

(Usage Note: Duplicate and complete the following for each source type.) -->
- **Source Type:** Clinical imaging centers using the Vectra WB360 scanner provided high-resolution TBP images with lesion annotations. These images were leveraged to create cropped datasets for lesion classification tasks.
- **Source Type:** Public health and cancer research organizations contributed clinical metadata and histopathological labels to enhance training and benchmarking.
- **Source Type:** Historical ISIC datasets served as reference baselines, but no direct reuse was applied unless harmonized via SLICE-3D standards.

**Additional Notes:** The dataset facilitates large-scale AI model development for early skin cancer detection in full-body imaging contexts.


#### Benefit and Value(s)
<!-- scope: periscope -->
<!-- info: Summarize the benefits of the resulting dataset to its consumers,
compared to the upstream source(s).

Use additional notes to capture any other relevant information or
considerations.

(Usage Note: Duplicate and complete the following for each source type.) -->

- **Source Type:** TBP imaging standardization allows consistent model performance benchmarking across clinical contexts.
- **Source Type:** Combination of imaging and metadata offers rich context for multimodal AI models.
- **Source Type:** Longitudinal data (2015–2024) enables the study of imaging trends, lesion evolution, and population coverage over time.

**Additional Notes:** Permissive and non-commercial licensing variants (CC-BY and CC-BY-NC) support academic and open-source research.

#### Limitation(s) and Trade-Off(s)
<!-- scope: microscope -->
<!-- info: What are the limitations of the resulting dataset to its consumers,
compared to the upstream source(s)?

Break down by source type.<br><br>(Usage Note: Duplicate and complete the
following for each source type.) -->
- **Source Type:** Slight imbalance in class labels (malignant vs. benign) due to real-world prevalence required resampling and augmentation.
- **Source Type:** Some diagnostic labels are weak (clinician-based), potentially affecting ground truth fidelity.
- **Source Type:** Metadata completeness varies slightly across institutions, limiting some cross-institutional comparisons.
